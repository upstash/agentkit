Add `@upstash/agentkit-eve-extension`: AgentKit as a mountable eve extension (eve ≥0.24). One file in `agent/extensions/` composes memory tools, schema-aware Redis Search tools, an opt-in durable chat-history hook, and a memory instructions fragment under one namespace.

`@upstash/agentkit-eve` moves to **eve 0.24.6** and **ai 7.0.30** (stable). Breaking: eve ≥0.24 replaced the sandbox backend handle's `dispose()` with `shutdown()` (fires only on server shutdown; the Upstash Box backend now pauses the box), and the `eve` peer range is now `>=0.24.0`.
