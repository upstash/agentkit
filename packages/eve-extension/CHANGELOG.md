# @upstash/agentkit-eve-extension

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- c198499: Rebuild on eve ≥0.25's dist packaging format (`eve.extension.source`/`.dist`, prebuilt `dist/extension` + compatibility manifest, dist-only tarball). Fixes installing the extension from npm: eve 0.25 rejects the old source-recompile format outright, and the prebuilt dist also removes the need to install `@upstash/agentkit-sdk` alongside the extension. Consumers need eve ≥0.25.2; apps that configure `search` also declare `@upstash/redis` themselves (their own mount file imports the `s` schema builder from it — a mount without `search` needs no extra installs).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 463c788: Add `@upstash/agentkit-eve-extension`: AgentKit as a mountable eve extension (eve ≥0.24). One file in `agent/extensions/` composes memory tools, schema-aware Redis Search tools, an opt-in durable chat-history hook, and a memory instructions fragment under one namespace.

  `@upstash/agentkit-eve` moves to **eve 0.24.6** and **ai 7.0.30** (stable). Breaking: eve ≥0.24 replaced the sandbox backend handle's `dispose()` with `shutdown()` (fires only on server shutdown; the Upstash Box backend now pauses the box), and the `eve` peer range is now `>=0.24.0`.
